This app is a calculator with the basic operations +-*/
The app is made with Android Studio using Kotlin.


I cant say im particulary proud of this version for android as much as the earlier which i made with C#.
I came into this with a disatvantage which is never having operated within Android Studio or used Kotlin.
I wanted to show that i can develop myself and increase my knowledge in a short period of time to
make up for the experience that im lacking. So that would be the only thing that im proud of.

There is alot that could have been better:
	-Better handling of errors
	-The does its calculation well the first time, but upon reset the user has to do some operations
	 before it works properly again(A logic mistake on my part that i cant see).
	-The dividation operator needs one operations in between everytime you want to divide your number.

Given more time i would have tried harder to fix these mistakes and find a better way to program the app.
I would also find more out about Android Studio and programming with Kotlin.
I would also add more complicated operations with parantheses and such.
