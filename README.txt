This application is a calculator with basic operation, +-*/.
It accepts negative numbers and decimals. The app is written in C# and made in Visual Studio
with the standard blank UWP creation as it is made as an Universal Windows App.
The .exe file doesnt run but the app is runnable with Visual Studio. Open up the .sln file and run it.
The executable file is in bin\x86\Release and is called calculator.exe.


There are certain things within code and project structures that could have been better.
Given more time i would have researched more on MVVM and done it in that structure.
For the code i would have improved it so as to find patterns and collect certain code
into methods to call.
I could also have tried to created my own UI templates and use that instead of reusing already made
standard template within visual studio.

I tried to implement a section where the app shows the user how to calculation is done with explanation.
But given the timeframe i wasnt able to do so. 
I would also make the calculator accept usage with the numpad.
